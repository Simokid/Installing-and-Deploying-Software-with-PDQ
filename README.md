<h1>Overview : Lab 10 Installing and Deploying Software with PDQ</h1>

This repository documents my home lab experience focused on **Installing and Deploying Software with PDQ** using **VirtualBox**. The lab involves setting up PDQ Deploy and PDQ Inventory to automate software deployment and manage system configurations across multiple virtual machines.

<h2>Objectives</h2>

- **Learn PDQ Deploy:** Explore how to automate the installation of software applications across multiple virtual machines.
- **Understand PDQ Inventory:** Set up and configure PDQ Inventory for system management and monitoring.
- **Network Configuration:** Use VirtualBox to simulate a network environment with different configurations and virtual machines.


<h2>Documentation</h2>

In this home lab, I will demonstrate how to install **PDQ Deploy**, create software packages, and deploy them. We will be primarily using **Windows Server 2022** for this lab environment. To begin, select **Devices** at the top of the VirtualBox menu, then choose **Insert Guest Additions CD Image**.
